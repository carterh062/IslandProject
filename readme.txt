sqllite can be recreated...the code is in the views.py file...just make sure to only call once


to set up database
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
And then you're all set.. just make sure to populate it with the code in the views file

^^ but the sql lite db is still here so it is unnessecary to do above steps if you don't want to test that code.

:) Hope you like it.
